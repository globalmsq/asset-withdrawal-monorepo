# Signing Service Status Update Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Status Flow
- Changed the final status from `BROADCASTING` to `SIGNED` when signing is completed
- The signing-service now only handles:
  - `SIGNING` - When starting to sign the transaction
  - `SIGNED` - When signing is successfully completed
  - `FAILED` - When signing fails
- `BROADCASTING` status will be set by the future tx-broadcaster service

### 2. Added TransactionStatus Enum
- Updated existing TransactionStatus enum in `packages/shared/src/types.ts` to include all status values:
  - PENDING
  - VALIDATING
  - SIGNING
  - SIGNED
  - BROADCASTING
  - COMPLETED
  - FAILED

### 3. Updated Code to Use Enum
- Modified `signing-worker.ts` to use `TransactionStatus` enum instead of string literals
- All status updates now use the enum values for type safety

### 4. Updated Tests
- Modified all test cases to use the `TransactionStatus` enum
- Updated expected status flow in tests from BROADCASTING to SIGNED
- All 26 tests continue to pass

## Status Flow After Changes

1. **PENDING** → Initial status when withdrawal request is created
2. **VALIDATING** → (Future) When validating the request
3. **SIGNING** → When signing-service starts processing
4. **SIGNED** → When signing is complete (NEW)
5. **BROADCASTING** → (Future) When tx-broadcaster starts broadcasting
6. **COMPLETED** → (Future) When transaction is confirmed
7. **FAILED** → When any step fails

## Benefits

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Each service is responsible for its own status updates
2. **Type Safety**: Using enum prevents typos and provides compile-time checking
3. **Better Tracking**: Can now distinguish between "signed but not broadcast" and "broadcasting"
4. **Future Ready**: tx-broadcaster can pick up from SIGNED status

## Testing Results

- ✅ All tests pass (26 tests)
- ✅ Linting passes
- ✅ Type checking passes
