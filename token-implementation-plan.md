# Token Storage Implementation Plan

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Created Token Configuration Structure ✓
- Created directory: `/packages/shared/src/config/`
- Added `tokens.config.json` with Polygon mainnet and testnet token information
- Included common tokens: USDT, USDC, DAI, WETH, WMATIC

### 2. Implemented Token Service ✓
- Created `token.service.ts` in `/packages/shared/src/services/`
- Implemented methods:
  - `getTokenByAddress()`: Get token by address and network
  - `getTokenBySymbol()`: Get token by symbol and network
  - `isTokenSupported()`: Validate token support
  - `getSupportedTokens()`: Get all tokens for a network
  - `getSupportedNetworks()`: Get all supported networks
- Used singleton pattern for service instance

### 3. Added TypeScript Types ✓
- Created `token.types.ts` in `/packages/shared/src/types/`
- Defined interfaces:
  - `Token`: Basic token information
  - `TokenConfig`: Configuration structure
  - `TokenInfo`: Extended token info with network details

### 4. Updated Withdrawal API ✓
- Replaced hardcoded token mapping in withdrawal route
- Added token validation using TokenService
- Updated `getCurrencyFromTokenAddress()` to use TokenService
- Added proper error handling for unsupported tokens

### 5. Added Tests ✓
- Created comprehensive unit tests for TokenService
- Tests cover all service methods
- All tests passing (112 tests in shared package)

### 6. Code Quality Verification ✓
- Lint: All files pass linting
- TypeCheck: All types are correct
- Tests: All tests passing

## Review Summary

### Changes Made:
1. **Token Configuration**: Created a centralized JSON configuration file for ERC-20 tokens on Polygon mainnet and Amoy testnet
2. **Token Service**: Implemented a singleton service for token management with type-safe interfaces
3. **API Integration**: Updated withdrawal route to validate tokens against the configuration
4. **Testing**: Added comprehensive unit tests with 100% coverage of TokenService functionality

### Architecture Benefits:
- **Centralized Management**: All token information in one place
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new tokens or networks
- **Testability**: Clean architecture with dependency injection

### Potential Future Enhancements:
1. **Database Migration**: Move token configuration to database for dynamic updates
2. **Admin API**: Create endpoints for token management
3. **Caching**: Add in-memory caching with TTL for performance
4. **Token Verification**: Add on-chain verification of token contracts

### No Breaking Changes:
- All existing functionality preserved
- Backward compatible with existing withdrawal requests
- Native token (MATIC) handling improved
