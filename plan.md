## Review and Approval

This plan is based on the architecture defined in introduce.md and reflects the current implementation status with phased progression. Each phase is independently testable and designed for gradual transition to production environment.

## Implementation Review (2025-07-17)

### Recent Updates
1. **Docker Database Connection Fix**:
   - Changed Prisma schema from hardcoded localhost to `env("DATABASE_URL")`
   - Removed debug console.log statements from DatabaseService
   - Services now properly connect to MySQL container using 'mysql' hostname

### Summary of Architecture Changes
- **Service Separation**: Extracted signing functionality from tx-processor into dedicated signing-service
- **Enhanced Security**: Implemented encrypted private key storage with AES-256-GCM in signing-service
- **Simplified Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns with api-server ‚Üí signing-service ‚Üí tx-broadcaster flow
- **Queue-based Processing**: Pure worker services without HTTP endpoints for better scalability

### Current System State
1. **Implemented Services**:
   - **api-server**: Receives HTTP requests and sends to tx-request-queue
   - **signing-service**: Processes queue messages, signs transactions, sends to signed-tx-queue
   - **tx-monitor**: Fully implemented but reserved for future phases

2. **Planned Services**:
   - **tx-broadcaster**: Will read from signed-tx-queue and broadcast to blockchain
   - **admin-api**: Administrative interface for system management

3. **Key Architectural Benefits**:
   - Single responsibility principle for each service
   - Enhanced security through service isolation
   - Horizontal scalability through queue-based architecture
   - Clear data flow: HTTP ‚Üí Queue ‚Üí Worker ‚Üí Queue ‚Üí Blockchain

### Critical Issue: Nonce Management
The current signing-service implementation has a critical flaw in nonce management:

1. **Current Problem**:
   - Nonce is fetched from Polygon network at startup
   - Incremented locally (+1) for each transaction
   - No persistence of used nonces
   - Service restart causes nonce reuse, leading to transaction failures

2. **Required Solution**:
   - Redis-based nonce management per address
   - Track last used nonce for each signing address
   - On service restart:
     - Check Redis for last used nonce
     - Compare with network nonce
     - Use the higher value to prevent conflicts
   - Atomic nonce increment operations

3. **Implementation Plan**:
   - Add Redis to Docker Compose setup
   - Create NonceCacheService in shared package
   - Update signing-service to use Redis for nonce tracking
   - Implement recovery logic for service restarts

## Database Schema Update (2025-07-13)

### Major Architecture Change: Added WithdrawalRequest Model
The system was missing a critical model to track withdrawal requests separately from blockchain transactions. This has been fixed by introducing the WithdrawalRequest model.

```prisma
model WithdrawalRequest {
  id            BigInt       @id @default(autoincrement()) @db.UnsignedBigInt
  requestId     String       @unique @db.VarChar(50) // tx-timestamp-random format
  amount        String       @db.VarChar(50)
  currency      String       @db.VarChar(10)
  toAddress     String       @db.VarChar(42)
  tokenAddress  String       @db.VarChar(42)
  network       String       @db.VarChar(20)
  status        String       @default("PENDING") @db.VarChar(20)
  errorMessage  String?      @db.Text
  createdAt     DateTime     @default(now())
  updatedAt     DateTime     @updatedAt

  @@index([status])
  @@index([requestId])
  @@map("withdrawal_requests")
}
```

### Updated Withdrawal Request Flow
1. **Request Creation**:
   - User submits withdrawal request via POST /withdrawal/request
   - System generates unique requestId (format: `tx-{timestamp}-{random}`)
   - Creates WithdrawalRequest record in DB with PENDING status
   - Sends request to SQS tx-request-queue

2. **Processing**:
   - tx-processor picks message from SQS
   - Updates WithdrawalRequest status: PENDING ‚Üí VALIDATING ‚Üí SIGNING ‚Üí BROADCASTING
   - Validates balance, network, and transaction parameters

3. **Transaction Creation**:
   - Only when txHash is generated (after blockchain broadcast)
   - Creates Transaction record with actual blockchain transaction data
   - Links via requestId field

4. **Completion**:
   - tx-monitor tracks blockchain confirmations
   - Updates WithdrawalRequest status to COMPLETED/FAILED
   - Records error messages if failed

### API Endpoint Updates Implemented
1. **POST /withdrawal/request**:
   - Saves WithdrawalRequest to DB before sending to SQS
   - Determines currency from tokenAddress (ETH for zero address)
   - Returns requestId for status tracking

2. **GET /withdrawal/status/:id**:
   - Queries WithdrawalRequest table using requestId
   - Joins with Transaction table for txHash if available
   - Returns comprehensive status information

3. **GET /withdrawal/queue/status**:
   - Shows accurate queue size using AWS GetQueueAttributes
   - Counts processing requests from DB (VALIDATING/SIGNING/BROADCASTING states)
   - Returns structured response with tx-request metrics

4. **GET /withdrawal/queue/items**:
   - Retrieves actual messages from SQS queue
   - Uses non-destructive read (visibilityTimeout: 0)
   - Shows queue URL and message details

### Configuration Updates
- Removed userId field from WithdrawalRequest model
- Fixed Swagger documentation for Docker environment
- Updated all test files to match new schema
- Added proper AWS_REGION configuration in docker-compose

### Current State (2025-07-16)
- Phase 1 core withdrawal processing system is partially complete
  - ‚úÖ api-server: Fully implemented
  - ‚úÖ signing-service: Fully implemented
  - ‚ùå tx-broadcaster: Not yet implemented (critical for completing the flow)
- Queue system with LocalStack SQS integration is operational
- AWS Secrets Manager integration with additional encryption layer
- Infrastructure ready for horizontal scaling

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Implement tx-broadcaster service** (critical for completing withdrawal flow)
   - Read signed transactions from signed-tx-queue
   - Broadcast to Polygon network
   - Handle transaction errors and retries
   - Update transaction status in database

2. **Complete signing-service validation logic**
   - Implement real balance checks
   - Add withdrawal limits validation
   - Enhanced security checks

3. **Phase 2: Admin System Development**
   - Admin API for transaction management
   - DLQ handler for error recovery
   - Monitoring dashboard

## Technical Notes

### Signing Service Architecture
- **Purpose**: Dedicated service for secure transaction signing
- **Security**: Implements defense-in-depth with AWS Secrets Manager + AES-256-GCM encryption
- **Scalability**: Stateless worker design allows horizontal scaling
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging for all signing operations

### Queue Architecture Benefits
- **Decoupling**: Services communicate asynchronously through queues
- **Resilience**: Failed messages automatically moved to DLQs
- **Scalability**: Multiple workers can process messages in parallel
- **Observability**: Queue metrics provide system health insights

### Development Environment
- **LocalStack**: Emulates AWS services locally
- **SQS Admin UI**: Visual queue monitoring at http://localhost:3999
- **Docker Compose**: Single command to start all services
- **Hot Reload**: Development servers auto-restart on code changes

## Nonce Management Architecture

### Problem Statement
The current implementation has a critical flaw where nonces are managed in-memory, causing transaction failures after service restarts due to nonce reuse.

### Solution Design

#### 1. Redis-based Nonce Cache
```typescript
interface NonceCache {
  // Get current nonce for address (atomic operation)
  getAndIncrement(address: string): Promise<number>;
  
  // Set nonce for address (used during recovery)
  set(address: string, nonce: number): Promise<void>;
  
  // Get current nonce without incrementing
  get(address: string): Promise<number | null>;
  
  // Clear nonce for address (for testing/recovery)
  clear(address: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

#### 2. Nonce Recovery Logic
```typescript
class NonceManager {
  async initialize(address: string): Promise<void> {
    // 1. Get last used nonce from Redis
    const cachedNonce = await redis.get(`nonce:${address}`);
    
    // 2. Get current nonce from blockchain
    const networkNonce = await provider.getTransactionCount(address);
    
    // 3. Use the higher value
    const startNonce = Math.max(cachedNonce || 0, networkNonce);
    
    // 4. Set in Redis
    await redis.set(`nonce:${address}`, startNonce);
  }
  
  async getNextNonce(address: string): Promise<number> {
    // Atomic increment and return
    return await redis.incr(`nonce:${address}`);
  }
}
```

#### 3. Implementation Steps
1. **Add Redis to Docker Compose**:
   - Redis container with persistence
   - Exposed port for development: 6379
   - Volume for data persistence

2. **Create NonceCacheService**:
   - Location: `packages/shared/src/services/nonce-cache.service.ts`
   - Redis client initialization
   - Atomic operations using INCR
   - Connection retry logic
   - Error handling

3. **Update SigningService**:
   - Remove in-memory nonce tracking
   - Initialize nonce from Redis on startup
   - Use atomic increment for each transaction
   - Handle nonce conflicts gracefully

4. **Add Monitoring**:
   - Track nonce usage per address
   - Alert on nonce conflicts
   - Monitor Redis health

### Benefits
- **Reliability**: Survives service restarts
- **Scalability**: Supports multiple signing-service instances
- **Atomicity**: Prevents race conditions
- **Observability**: Easy to monitor and debug
