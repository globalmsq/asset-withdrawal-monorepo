# Cleanup Summary - Asset Withdrawal Monorepo

## Cleanup Performed

### 1. ✅ Replaced Console Statements with Proper Logging

**Files Updated:**

- `apps/tx-broadcaster/src/services/broadcaster.ts` - 5 console.error + 2 console.warn → logger methods
- `apps/tx-broadcaster/src/services/queue-client.ts` - 3 console.error → logger.error
- `apps/tx-broadcaster/src/services/chain-config.service.ts` - 3 console.error + 1 console.log → logger methods
- `apps/tx-broadcaster/src/services/redis-client.ts` - 1 console.error → logger.error
- `apps/tx-broadcaster/src/worker/sqs-worker.ts` - 1 console.error → logger.error

**Total:** 16 console statements replaced with LoggerService

### 2. ✅ Environment Files Status

**Already Properly Configured:**

- All `.env` files are already in `.gitignore`
- No `.env` files are tracked in git repository
- Environment example files (`.env.example`) are properly maintained

### 3. ✅ Code Quality Improvements

**Improvements Made:**

- Added LoggerService imports where missing
- Maintained consistent logging format across services
- Preserved error context and metadata in log messages
- All changes validated with TypeScript and ESLint

### 4. ✅ Validation Results

**Tests Passed:**

- ✅ TypeScript compilation: No errors
- ✅ ESLint: All files pass linting
- ✅ No breaking changes introduced

## Remaining Cleanup Opportunities (Low Priority)

### TODO Comments

- 2 TODO comments in `apps/tx-broadcaster/src/worker/sqs-worker.ts` for monitoring system integration
- These are legitimate placeholders for future production features

### Log Files

- Log files exist but are already ignored by git
- Can be manually cleaned with: `find . -name "*.log" -type f -delete`

### Hardhat Console Statements

- Console statements in `docker/hardhat/` test and deploy scripts
- These are acceptable for development/debugging purposes

## Recommendations

### Phase 1 (Complete) ✅

- [x] Replace console statements with proper logging
- [x] Verify environment files are not tracked
- [x] Validate code quality

### Phase 2 (Optional)

- [ ] Implement monitoring system integration (address TODOs)
- [ ] Set up log rotation for production
- [ ] Review and update deprecated dependencies

### Phase 3 (Future)

- [ ] Implement structured logging with correlation IDs
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Set up automated cleanup scripts

## Impact Assessment

**Risk Level:** Low

- All changes are non-breaking
- Improved logging consistency
- Better debugging capabilities
- No functionality changes

**Benefits:**

- Consistent logging across services
- Better error tracking in production
- Cleaner codebase
- Improved maintainability

## Commands for Manual Cleanup (Optional)

```bash
# Clean log files
find . -name "*.log" -type f -delete

# Clean temporary files
find . -name "*.tmp" -type f -delete
find . -name ".DS_Store" -type f -delete

# Check for unused dependencies
npx depcheck
```

## Conclusion

The cleanup has been successfully completed with minimal risk. The main improvement was replacing console statements with proper logging using LoggerService, which will improve debugging and monitoring capabilities in production environments.
