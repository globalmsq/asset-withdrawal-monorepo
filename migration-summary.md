# PolygonProvider to ChainProvider Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated both `signing-service` and `tx-processor` from using the hardcoded `PolygonProvider` to the dynamic `ChainProvider` that supports multiple blockchain networks.

## Changes Made

### 1. signing-service
- **TransactionSigner**: Updated to use `ChainProvider` instead of `PolygonProvider`
- **SigningWorker**: 
  - Now creates signers dynamically based on chain/network from queue messages
  - Uses Map to store multiple signers per chain/network combination
  - Extracts chain/network from `WithdrawalRequest` messages
- **MulticallService**: 
  - Made gas configuration chain-agnostic
  - Added support for chain-specific gas limits
  - Renamed `POLYGON_GAS_CONFIG` to `DEFAULT_GAS_CONFIG`

### 2. tx-processor
- **TransactionSigner**: Updated to use `ChainProvider` instead of `PolygonProvider`
- **NonceManager**: Updated imports to use `ChainProvider`
- **TransactionSenderWorker**: 
  - Creates providers dynamically based on chain/network from messages
  - Uses Maps to store multiple providers/signers
- **ValidationSigningWorker**: 
  - Creates providers dynamically based on chain/network
  - Validates chain/network support using `ChainProviderFactory`
- **Types**: Added chain/network fields to `SignedTransaction` type
- **Configuration**: Removed polygon-specific configuration from `config.ts`
- **Cleanup**: Deleted `polygon-provider.ts` file as it's no longer needed

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Dynamic Provider Creation**: Both services now create chain providers on-demand based on the chain/network specified in queue messages
2. **Map-based Storage**: Using Maps to store providers/signers per chain/network combination for efficiency
3. **Lazy Initialization**: Providers are only created when first needed
4. **Chain Validation**: Using `ChainProviderFactory.getProvider()` to validate supported chains
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Default to 'polygon' chain if not specified in messages

## Benefits

1. **Multi-chain Support**: System can now handle transactions on any supported blockchain
2. **Dynamic Configuration**: No need to restart services to support new chains
3. **Resource Efficiency**: Only creates providers for chains actually being used
4. **Better Separation**: Chain selection is now driven by business logic (queue messages) rather than configuration

## Next Steps

1. Update tests for both services to cover multi-chain scenarios
2. Test with different blockchain networks (Ethereum, BSC, localhost)
3. Consider adding chain-specific transaction validation logic
4. Document supported chains and their configuration in README
