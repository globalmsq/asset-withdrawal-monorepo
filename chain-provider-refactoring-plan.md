# Chain Provider Refactoring Plan

## Summary

Successfully refactored the polygon-provider from signing-service to a shared chain provider that supports multiple blockchains (Polygon, Ethereum, BSC) for both mainnet and testnet environments.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Chain Configuration (packages/shared/src/config/chains.config.json)
- Added configuration for multiple chains:
  - Polygon (Mainnet: 137, Testnet: Amoy 80002)
  - Ethereum (Mainnet: 1, Testnet: Sepolia 11155111)
  - BSC (Mainnet: 56, Testnet: 97)
- Each chain includes RPC URL, chain ID, native currency info, and block explorer URL

### 2. Created Chain Types (packages/shared/src/types/chain.types.ts)
- Defined TypeScript types for chain configuration
- ChainNetwork: 'mainnet' | 'testnet'
- ChainName: 'polygon' | 'ethereum' | 'bsc'
- ChainConfig interface for chain details
- ChainProviderOptions for creating providers

### 3. Created Chain Provider (packages/shared/src/providers/chain.provider.ts)
- Generic blockchain provider class that works with any supported chain
- Supports all essential blockchain operations:
  - Getting balances, block numbers, transaction receipts
  - Estimating gas with 20% buffer
  - Sending transactions
  - Fee data and gas price retrieval
- Helper methods for chain identification (isPolygon(), isEthereum(), etc.)
- Methods for generating block explorer URLs

### 4. Created Chain Provider Factory (packages/shared/src/providers/chain-provider.factory.ts)
- Factory pattern for creating and caching chain providers
- Singleton instances per chain/network combination
- Convenience methods for each chain type
- Ability to use custom RPC URLs

### 5. Updated Signing Service
- Modified transaction-signer.ts to use ChainProvider instead of PolygonProvider
- Updated nonce-manager.ts to work with ChainProvider
- Updated signing-worker.ts to create ChainProvider using factory

### 6. Added Comprehensive Tests
- Created chain.provider.test.ts with 21 test cases
- Tests cover all supported chains and networks
- Tests for factory pattern and caching behavior
- All tests passing

## Benefits

1. **Reusability**: Chain provider can now be used by tx-broadcaster and other services
2. **Multi-chain Support**: Easy to add support for new chains by updating configuration
3. **Type Safety**: Strong TypeScript types ensure compile-time safety
4. **Centralized Configuration**: All chain configurations in one place
5. **Caching**: Provider instances are cached for performance
6. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new blockchain networks in the future

## Next Steps

When implementing tx-broadcaster or other services that need blockchain interaction:
1. Import ChainProviderFactory from '@asset-withdrawal/shared'
2. Create provider using factory methods (e.g., `ChainProviderFactory.createPolygonProvider('mainnet')`)
3. Use the provider for all blockchain operations

## Testing

All tests pass:
- Linting: ✓
- Type checking: ✓
- Unit tests: ✓ (21 tests passing for chain provider, 26 tests passing for signing-service)

The signing-service continues to work exactly as before, but now uses the shared chain provider infrastructure.

## Additional Cleanup

- Removed the old `polygon-provider.ts` file from signing-service
- Removed the old `polygon-provider.test.ts` test file
- Updated all signing-service tests to use the new ChainProvider from shared package
- Fixed all test mocks to properly simulate ChainProvider behavior
